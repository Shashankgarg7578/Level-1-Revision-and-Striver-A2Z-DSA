//3. Number of Subarrays where <Condition> :- using pattern-2(Longest subarray all 3 concepts)
   
//Q. if the problem is given like :- No. of subaarays with sum = k
//then we have to follow below rule
//Ans.   (no. of sub arrays where sum <= k)    = x
//       (no. of sub arrays where sum <= k-1)  = y
//                                             => (x-y)
 
//4. Shortest/Minimum window <condition> :- shrinked till condition
//    shortest shrinked window is the ans
